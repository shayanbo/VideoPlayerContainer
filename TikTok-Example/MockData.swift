            "why does daigo keep doing crouch medium punches? Does that beat abels rolls?",
            "A little backstory; Japan got this game a good six month or more before the west got it. That's half a year more of practice. The first Evo we basically were playing catch up to them, it really showed in terms of option selects and set ups. Justin being Justin closed the gap, but if he'd started the same time as Daigo, this could have swung to Wong for the win. Still epic either way.",
